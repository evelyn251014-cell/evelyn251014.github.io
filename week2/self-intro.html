    <h1>Evelyn Lim Qian En</h1>
    <h3>Money and I are best friends </h3>
    <p>Good morning. My name is Evelyn Lim, and I’m turning 20 this year. I’m a student at Dasein Academy of Art,
        majoring in Digital Media.At the same time, I work as a part-time teacher. I teach kindergarten and primary
        school students. I teach them basic art skills, such as how to draw using shapes and how to mix and blend colors
        using different art tools like crayons, poster colors, and acrylic markers.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don’t really have many hobbies. Most of the time, I watch TV series and reality shows during my free time.
        Recently, I’ve started exploring a new type of art called nail art. I really enjoy it, even though it takes a
        longer time to complete each design. Also I’m a dog person, and I have three male dogs at home. They’re very
        cute, but most of the time they’re quite
        crazy, which brings a lot of fun to our family.
    </p>
